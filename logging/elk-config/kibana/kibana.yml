# =================== Kibana Configuration ===================
#
# This configuration file is pre-configured for running Kibana within the
# AISavvy Docker Compose setup.
#

# Default Kibana configuration for docker target
server.host: "0.0.0.0"
server.shutdownTimeout: "5s"

# Point Kibana to the Elasticsearch container.
# 'elasticsearch' is the service name defined in our docker-compose.yml file.
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://elasticsearch:9200"]

# Increase the request timeout to give Elasticsearch more time to start,
# preventing race conditions.
elasticsearch.requestTimeout: 90000

# Tell Kibana's migration process that a 'yellow' cluster status is acceptable.
# This is critical for single-node Elasticsearch clusters where the status
# will never become 'green' because there are no replica shards.
migrations.waitForIndexStatus: "yellow"

# Optional: You can add other settings below as needed.
# For example, to change the default logging behavior:
# logging.dest: stdout
# logging.verbose: false
